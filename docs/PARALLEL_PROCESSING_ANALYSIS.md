## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Architecture

### Parallel Processing Design

The implementation uses **ThreadPoolExecutor** for I/O-bound parallel processing:

```python
class ParallelTableExtractor(TableExtractor):
    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = 5):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_workers = max_workers
        
    def process_folder_parallel(self, input_folder, output_folder):
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
            # Submit all tasks
            future_to_file = {
                executor.submit(self._process_single_file, file_path, output_folder): file_path
                for file_path in image_files
            }
            
            # Collect results as they complete
            for future in as_completed(future_to_file):
                result = future.result()
                # Process results...
```

### Why ThreadPoolExecutor?

1. **I/O-Bound Nature:** Document AI API calls are network-bound operations
2. **Shared Resources:** Single Document AI client instance across threads
3. **Lower Overhead:** Minimal memory footprint compared to multiprocessing
4. **Error Isolation:** Individual file failures don't affect other processes
5. **Progress Tracking:** Real-time monitoring of batch progress
